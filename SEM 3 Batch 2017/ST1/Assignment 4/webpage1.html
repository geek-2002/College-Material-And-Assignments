<h2>Cricket</h2>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. It is set on a cricket field centred on a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with two wickets each comprising a bail balanced on three stumps. For each phase of play, or innings, a batting side tries to score as many runs as possible after striking the cricket ball thrown at the wicket (or delivery) with the bat, while a bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal can include being bowled, when the ball directly hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings end and the teams swap roles.</p>
