'''

import math â†’ This will include Python's
inbuilt directory 'math'.
It contains many mathematical functions
for our use.
import is a keyword used to import any
available directory.

math.sin() computes sine of a given angle.
math.cos() computes cosine of a given angle.
math.pow(a,b) computes a raised to the
power of b (ab).

We have imported 'math'
and these functions are inside it,
so 'math.sin()' can be understood as
'sin()' from 'math' directory.

# import math
# print(math.sin(30))
# print(math.cos(10))
# print(math.pow(2,3))

# print(math.pi)




# import math as m

# print(m.pi)
# print(m.e)






import math             #You need to put this command,`import` keyword along with the name of the module you want to import
num = 4
print(math.sqrt(num))   #Use dot operator to access sqrt() inside module "math"
